# Mouse Classifier
This project focuses on feature learning, model training, and evaluation using real-time or recorded mouse data.

# Demonstration
A demonstration can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/code/isaaclinus/mabe-submission-portfolio
This notebook loads data and a trained model and creates predictions in the form of a .csv file.

# Overview
The Mouse Classifier analyzes mouse movement and predicts the class of behavior they correspond to. The goal is not only accuracy, but also robustness with limited data collected across many labs, mice living environments, and with many different mice.

# Features
Mouse movement data ingestion

Feature extraction from raw (x, y, t) cursor traces

Supervised classification using standard ML models

Evaluation with accuracy and confusion metrics from Kaggle
