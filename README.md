# MIT Maker Portfolio

This repository contains selected work from my personal maker portfolio, submitted as part of my MIT application. The projects here reflect how I explore mathematics, machine learning, and software systems through independent, self-directed work.

The primary project in this repository is a from-scratch implementation of the **Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)** reinforcement learning algorithm. Full technical details, code structure, and usage instructions are documented in the project-specific README.

➡ **See [`sac/README.md`](./sac/README.md) for details.**

## How I work

Most of my work is done independently, outside of formal labs or structured programs. I rely on a web browser for research and references and PyCharm for development. Projects are driven by curiosity and conceptual questions rather than external requirements.

## Notes for reviewers

Some projects were version-controlled after initial development to make review easier. Commit history reflects documentation and cleanup rather than the full chronological development process.

Thank you for taking the time to review my work :)
